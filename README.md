A Flask web application that converts user-provided text and images into engaging reels. 
The app uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to transform text into natural-sounding audio, synchronizes it with uploaded images, and combines them into a video using FFmpeg. 
Features include smooth transitions, multilingual voice support, and ready-to-share reel export â€” perfect for content creators and social media use.
